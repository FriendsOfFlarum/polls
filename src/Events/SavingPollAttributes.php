/**
 * Dispatched while a poll is being saved
 * This event is triggered in both SavePollsToDatabase and EditPollHandler, which don't have the same data format!
 * For this reason the "attributes" part of the JSON:API payload is provided as a separate attribute since it's almost identical for both situations.
 *
 * The create/edit authorization has already been performed when this event is dispatched, so it doesn't need to be checked again
 *
 * You should not throw any exception if the poll doesn't exist because this happens after the discussion has already been created and would break email and other extensions
